🔐 Project Overview
📌 Title:
Guarding Transactions with AI-Powered Credit Card Fraud Detection and Prevention

🎯 Objective:
To design and implement a robust, intelligent, and scalable system that uses machine learning to detect and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time, improving transaction security and reducing financial loss.

🚀 Key Features
✅ 1. AI-Driven Fraud Detection
Uses advanced machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) trained on historical transaction data.

Supports real-time inference for guarding individual transactions.

🔄 2. Data Preprocessing & Scaling
Applies feature scaling using StandardScaler to normalize input features.

Handles imbalanced datasets common in fraud detection using scale_pos_weight and stratified splits.

📊 3. Advanced Modeling
Supports plug-and-play modeling with:

XGBoost

Random Forest

Can be extended to neural networks with TensorFlow or PyTorch.

📁 4. Modular Code Structure
Cleanly organized into model/, pipeline/, and utils/ for maintainability.

Configurable via a central config.yaml file.

📜 5. Logging & Monitoring
Logs every transaction with prediction and confidence score.

Ensures transparency and auditability for compliance and debugging.

🔔 6. Alert System
Triggers real-time fraud alerts if the model’s fraud confidence exceeds a defined threshold.

Supports alert routing (print/logging; can be extended to email/SMS/webhook).

🧠 7. Retraining Pipeline
Scheduled retraining (e.g., daily) using updated transaction data.

Keeps the model updated with new fraud patterns via schedule module.

🖥️ 8. CLI Interface
Command-line tool for testing and guarding individual transactions.

Enables testing, debugging, or integration with other systems via terminal.
